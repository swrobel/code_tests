# StackSocial Frontend challenge

This challenge is designed to test your skill with:

* Javascript
* HTML5/CSS3 (specifically media queries/responsive design)
* Consuming RESTful APIs
* Git

**This should hopefully take you about 90 minutes.**

1. Create a page that, at a minimum, does the following:
    * Is built with HTML5/CSS3
    * Consumes the [500px Popular Images API](https://github.com/500px/api-documentation/blob/master/endpoints/photo/GET_photos.md) - here's a [sample request](https://api.500px.com/v1/photos?feature=popular&image_size=4&consumer_key=5m5ALqjAbzAL1Cnszfu0DMUIZRL4jY2crYnDlGgt) with a consumer_key you can use for your app.
    * Displays the top 10 popular photos in a responsive gallery that scales well at resolutions from 320x480 up to 1920x1080
1. Bonus points for:
    * Including a category picker that pulls the 10 popular images in that category
    * Linking to each image's user's photo stream
    * Anything else cool that we can't think of!
1. Email a link to a github repo with the code to `devs@stacksocial.com`

Feedback is welcome if you found it too easy/hard/whatever.
