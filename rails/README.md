# StackSocial Rails challenge

**This should hopefully take you about 90 minutes.**

1. Create a Rails 3.2 app that, at a minimum, does the following:
    * Is hosted on [Heroku](http://heroku.com) (you should be able to use the free plan)
    * Consumes the [Twitter API](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/api)
    * Displays the time & content of the last 25 tweets for any given twitter handle
1. Bonus points for:
    * Caching identical API calls for ~5min to avoid hammering the Twitter API
    * Logging queries to a database and having a page to show a log
    * Parsing @mentions in tweets and linking to the status pages for those 
    * Anything else cool that we can't think of!
1. Email a link to your working Heroku app and github repo with the code to `devs@stacksocial.com`

Feedback is welcome if you found it too easy/hard/whatever.
