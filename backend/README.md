# Backend challenge

This challenge is designed to test your skill with:

* Web Frameworks
* Consuming RESTful APIs
* Git
* Deploying to the cloud

**This should take you about 90 minutes.**

1. Create a web app that, at a minimum, does the following:
    * Is hosted on [Heroku](http://heroku.com) (you should be able to use the free plan) or some other cloud platform
    * Consumes the [Twitter API](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/api)
    * Displays the time & content of the last 25 tweets for any given twitter handle (doesn't have to be pretty)
1. Bonus points for:
    * Writing tests!
    * Caching identical API calls for ~5min to avoid hammering the Twitter API
    * Logging queries to a database and having a page to show a log
    * Parsing @mentions in tweets and linking to the status pages for those
    * Anything else cool that we can't think of!
1. Email a link to your working Heroku app and github repo with the code

Feedback is welcome if you found it too easy/hard/whatever.
